## üöÄ About The Project

Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally. Early prediction of heart disease can be crucial for timely intervention and treatment. This project aims to build a simple yet effective tool that leverages machine learning to assess the risk of heart disease based on common medical attributes.

This application demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to building a functional GUI for real-world interaction.
